# PFDS

My translation of example code from Chris Okasaki's "Purely Functional
Data Structures" paper from Standard ML to Common Lisp. This is a
work-in-progress, I may never finish it.

## Usage

Use it as a code reference while reading the paper if you are more
familiar with Common Lisp than Standard ML.
